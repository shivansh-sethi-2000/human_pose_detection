## human_pose_detection

DL Model to build:
Used MediaPipe's DL models (Human Pose detection) to create dataset and create DL model to detect these 4 different actions - left hand up, right hand up, both hands up, both hands down. 
Model will take image as input and be able to predict one of these actions in it correctly every time. 
tried transfer learning on a pre-trained model or train custom model. 
To create dataset, Used the model(s) from MediaPipe's DL models that are appropriate for this task.
